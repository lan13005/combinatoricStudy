Extracting the weight factors for 3 different tracking schemes. Takes in the flat tree from the DSelector stage and requires the number of degrees of freedom and chiSq as a fundamental branch. 
- best chi squared
- equal weights, combo weighted by 1/N where N is the number of combos in an event that passed some selections
- probablity weighted, similar to above but the weight is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{p_i}{\sum{p_j}}" />. This approach has the two above methods as limits.
